Hello, 'verse. 
I am currently seeking employment. 

I have experience in Python, Java, Scala, R, SQL, and Matlab as well as AWS, ELK stack and other various Big-Data ML tools.
(And C++ and Linux because How do you get a CS degree without those, too?)

The thing I have the most experience in? Learning new things well enough to use them and teach someone else how to use them, too.

My ideal workplace fosters a culture that encourages research into cutting edge tech, creating quality products for their clients, and a collaborative workforce that telecommutes. 

I'm a coder, a geek, a nerd. I like math, stats, machine learning, programming and analyzing data. I like Star Trek and podcasts like the Magic Tavern and Greatest Gen. I play video games, currently trying out some fun garden mods in Rimworld. I'm re-discovering Dark and Light. I use my current spare time to create useful code snippets like "remove outliers" and will continue to add to my tools repository. I also do fun things like use machine learning to predict the March Madness tournament -poorly- but well enough to win my previous work team's competition.
